# Word Guessing Game

## Purpose
This was an end of the chapter project for the Object Oriented Programing portion of the bootcamp. The chapter incorperated using testing as well as constructor functions and the overall use of objects. There were several gaming orriented exerises so this one was pretty similar to the rest of the chapters material. 

## Process
This was another assignment we skipped during the course of the bootcamp. It was one of the few consclusion excesise we skipped. The idea was easy enough to build out each model. the idea of interweaving them ewas where I ran into most of my trouble but that was easily understood by just looking over some of the previous examples.
